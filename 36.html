<h3><center>Use your electricity ONLY when necessary. For example, turn your lamp on when it is too dark for you to read your assignments. </center></h3>
<h3><center>Using just enough energy helps prevent the overuse of fossil fuels, which release carbon dioxide gas into the air. </center></h3>
<h3><center>CO2 is bad for the environment because, when in the atmosphere, it causes temperatures to rise all over the world. </center></h3>
<h3><center>It has already started and if it continues at its current alarming speed, by the year 2150, global temperature will be five to eleven degrees warmer.</center></h3>
<h3><center>Once that happens, many species of animals(maybe even humans) may become extinct.</center></h3>
