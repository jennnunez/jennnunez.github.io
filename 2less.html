<h3><center>You understand that it is wasteful to use energy when it is not necessary.</center></h3> 
<h3><center>However, do you fully understand why?</center></h3>
<h3><center>We use energy when we keep the lights on (even when not needed), burn coal, and use fossil fuels.</center></h3>
<h3><center>Fossil fuels release a gas, called carbon dioxide(CO2), into the air.</center></h3>
<h3><center>CO2 is bad for the environment because, when in the atmosphere, it causes temperatures to rise all over the world.</center></h3> 
<h3><center>As it gets hotter, the glaciers in the artic will begin to melt.</center></h3>
<h3><center>This has already started in the artic. If it continues at its current (alarming) speed, by the year 2150, global temperature will be five to eleven degrees warmer.</center></h3>
<h3><center>Many species of animals will not be able to adjust to the new environment; even the human race may become extinct.
