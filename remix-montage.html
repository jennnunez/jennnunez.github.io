     <p>Addicted to Digital Media
	My montage serves as a metaphor to how the creation of Digital Media (the database in particular) has caused many people to become addicted to their devices. Just as many people have fallen prey to the addiction of consuming alcohol, cigarettes, and pills, we are now starting to become equally dependent on the use of digital media. In the image, three people mimic the action of consuming well-known addictions (alcohol, cigarettes, and other drugs); however, each itemâ€™s original logos have been replaced by some of the most popular phone applications of 2017, and now each person consumes their social media addiction.
Although the image is also set indoors, the people inside pay no mind to each other. This exhibits how outside forces are ignored and how this addiction destroys any chances for interactions, further confirming that this addiction has led us to mentally and physically isolate ourselves from others, as well as our surroundings. My montage demonstrates how digital media has helped us adapt to a world that lacks in-person communication and connections.
This is my remix montage.</p>
