     <h1>3D Landscape</h1>

     <p>A decade ago, the crime rates in San Jose were below 35 percent of the U.S. and California averages. However, last year San Jose’s crime rate climbed 3 percent above the California average and over 1 percent of U.S. average; it’s average was higher than Los Angeles and San Diego’s crime rates. This 3-D model has a base with “blocks” of differing shapes and sizes; each “block” is stacked one after another. The differing heights of the blocks reflect the crime rates in San Jose; the highest block (on the very top) is where crime happens most often.</p>
