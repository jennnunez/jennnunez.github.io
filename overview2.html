	<h3><center>Reduce, reuse, recycle</center></h3>
	
	><center><dfn>Reducing</dfn> is cutting back on the amount of trash we make.</center></p>
	<p><center><dfn>Reusing</dfn> is finding new ways to use materials again so that we throw out less.</center></p>
	<p><center><dfn>Recycling</dfn> is using trash to remake new goods so that they can be sold again.</center></p>
	
	<h3><center>Transportation options</center></h3>
	
	<p><center>Walking and riding a bike are great options when thinking about what would be most beneficial for the environment.</center></p> 
	<p><center>Both allow for exercise to occur, and these kinds of transportation methods use less energy and pollute less air.</center></p>
	
	<h3><center>Electricity usage</center></h3>
	<p><center>We use energy when we keep the lights on (even when not needed), burn coal, and use fossil fuels.</center></p>
	<p><center>Fossil fuels release a gas, called carbon dioxide(CO2), into the air.</center></p>
	<p><center>CO2 is bad for the environment because, when in the atmosphere, it causes temperatures to rise all over the world.</center></p> <p><center>As it gets hotter, the glaciers in the artic will begin to melt.</center></p>
	<p><center>This has already started in the artic. If it continues at its current (alarming) speed, by the year 2150, global temperature will be five to eleven degrees (celcius) warmer.</center></p>
	<p><center>Many species of animals will not be able to adjust to the new environment; even the human race may become extinct.
	</center></p>

	<h3><center>Consumption of meat</center></h3>
	
	<p><center>Meat production is costly in more than one way as raising livestock for food uses a large amounts of land, water, energy and other resources. </center></p>
	<p><center>Production for these animals cause greehouse-gases, that trap and hold heat (i.e. carbon dioxide) to be released into the atmosphere, which increases the rates of global warming.
	</center></p>
	<p><center>Try substituting your meat portions with a serving of beans, brocolli, peanuts, etc.;</center></p>
	<p><center>you can find some of these food options in your local farmers market.</center></p>
	
	
	<h3><center>Why it is important to know our ecological footprint?</center></h3>
	<p><center>Understanding and knowing when our natural resources are being exhausted at alarming rates forces societies to make changes that not only satisfy their needs, but also the needs of the planet.</center></p>
