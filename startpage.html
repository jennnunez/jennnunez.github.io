<h2><center>What is an Ecological Footprint?</center></h2>

<h3><center>An <dfn>ecological footprint</dfn> is the impact a person, or group of people, are making to the environment.</center></h3>
<h3><center>It measures the amount of natural resources we use in order to sustain our lifestyles.</center></h3>
<h3><center>For example, the amount of water you use when you shower/bathe, and how the overuse of clean water will soon lead to there being no clean water at all.</center></h3>

<h2><center>Why is knowing this important to learn?</center></h2>

<h3><center>The environment is made up of your surroundings: the plants, animals, and people around you.</center></h3>
<h3><center>It is important to learn how your daily routines are helping to improve or harm the environment.</center></h3>
<h3><center>When you do not take care of your environment, you are harming not only yourself, but everything and everyone else who surrounds you.</center></h3>
<h3><center>Like the example above, once all the clean water is gone, there will be no water to clean yourself with, to drink, or to use for anything else.</center></h3>
<h3><center>However, you are still in time to change and do better for the world you live in!!</center></p>
