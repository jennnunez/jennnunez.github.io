     <h1>Addicted to Digital Media Animation</h1>

	<p><center>Just as many people have fallen prey to the addiction of consuming alcohol, cigarettes, and pills, we are now starting to become equally dependent on the use of digital media. In the animation, three people are shown consuming well-known addictions (alcohol, cigarettes, and other drugs); however, each item’s original logos have been replaced by some of the most popular phone applications of 2017, and now each person consumes their social media addiction. The viewer is able to see and hear how each person struggles to control their obsession as they continue to engage in these activities. The addictions begin to slowly consume each individual until finally there is nothing left but the destruction of one’s mental and physical self.
